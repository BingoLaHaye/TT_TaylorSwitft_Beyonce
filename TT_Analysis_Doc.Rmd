## Geting the data

```{r}
# lets get this in manually
library(readr)
beyonce_lyrics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/beyonce_lyrics.csv')
taylor_swift_lyrics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/taylor_swift_lyrics.csv')
sales <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/sales.csv')
charts <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/charts.csv')
```

## Analysis

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
```
So like what do I want to do? Maybe see the sentiment between the albums they both make and the sales they see from those albums. IDK might be intersting we just want to do something quick.


```{r}

```
